# Advanced Clipboard
Advanced Clipboard is a multi-platform software made through PyQt and other packages that allows the user to utilize up to 10 clipboards for copying and pasting text. It is currently in an early stage of development where it has only been tested on linux, so I can't garuntee that it will work on other platforms.

Use at your own risk!
